# Car price prediction

The python file trains a machine learning model to predict the car price in Spain based on the car type, age, fuel type, mileage and gearbox type. When you run this python notebook, it will create and save the trained model in the directory. You can use this model in your final product.

## Task1

Build a web interface/web application/API that predicts car prices based on user inputs include make, model year, fuel type, gear type, and mileage using the provided pre-trained machine learning model.

## Requirements

1. Load the pre-trained car price prediction model created by this python notebook.
2. Create a web interface/web application/API that accepts the following user inputs:
   1. Car make (e.g. BMW)
   2. Model year (e.g. 2018)
   3. Fuel type (e.g. Diesel)
   4. Transmission type (e.g. Manual)
   5. Mileage (e.g. 10000)
3. Pass the user inputs to the pre-trained model to generate a predicted car price
4. Display the predicted price back to the user

## Task2

What techniques could be used to further improve this ML model performance (e.g. better prediction accuracy, better generalisation ability against overfitting, etc.)? If so, can you apply the techniques you'd propose to re-train another ML model and compare the difference?
